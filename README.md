# Meshtastic Ham Club Presentation
Presentation to local ham clubs: Meshtastic - What's In It For Me?

There's an intended double meaning in the title.
This presentation describes what I've found valuable in Meshtastic myself.
But it also describes what a ham club audience might find in it for themselves.

I delivered this presentation at the
[Argonne Amateur Radio Club meeting on May 7, 2025](https://blogs.anl.gov/amateur-radio/page/2/).

My presentation style is heavy on visuals and light on bullets,
with my narration giving the key points verbally.
The GitHub audience necessarily misses out compared to
the live audiences.
